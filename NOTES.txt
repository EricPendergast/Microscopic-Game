General idea:
    you are a cell 
    there are bad cells
    you want to stay alive
    there is an infinite(?) world
    you can stockpile goods
        do this because there is day and night
        at night bad things happen?

    you want to divide?
        need to think of some sort of motivation for this.
        Dividing gives you an extra life?

    each cell part is like an organelle
        mitochondria
        flagella
        nucleus
        grabber thingy
        digester thingy
        oxygen?
        anaeroboc?
        stabilizer: keeps nearby cell parts in place
        toxin pump

        membrane
        chloroplasts
        mitochondria

    somehow disincentivise being too large
    you can take parts from other cells

    bad guys:
        Amoebas
        stentors
        multicellular life??
        bacteria: take cell parts, produce toxins?

    Membrane functoinality:
        should be 1 layer thick

    Cytoskeleton can hold the structure, but it doesn't block anything



Visuals:
    Floaty specks
    perlin noise background, with finer-grained perlin noise moving at a different rate on top of it (like clouds)

    step 1 get perlin noise working

    step 2 get regularly spaced specks
