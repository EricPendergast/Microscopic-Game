✓get a simple cytoskeleton editor
Make membranes have a better distance
    Idea:
        Make each membrane cell part try to lessen the angle between its left
        and right neighbors
    ✓Idea 2:
        Make the membranes commit more to their neighbors
        i.e. they only change neighbors when their connection breaks

✓ add a background parralax effect
Make the front stuff be in front of the cells

✓ Make it so that cell parts use colliders to find nearby cells

rename SimplePart to CellPart

joint interface: What if MakeJoint and GetJoint only succeed if the calling cellpart has permission to edit the joint?

Decide if a joint wrapper class needs to be created
