✓get a simple cytoskeleton editor
✓Make membranes have a better distance
    Idea:
        Make each membrane cell part try to lessen the angle between its left
        and right neighbors
    ✓Idea 2:
        Make the membranes commit more to their neighbors
        i.e. they only change neighbors when their connection breaks

✓ add a background parralax effect
Make the front stuff be in front of the cells

✓ Make it so that cell parts use colliders to find nearby cells

rename SimplePart to CellPart

✓ joint interface: What if MakeJoint and GetJoint only succeed if the calling cellpart has permission to edit the joint?

✓Decide if a joint wrapper class needs to be created

Dragging behavior:
    Left click drag always pulls the object to the cursor
    Cytoskeleton
        right click drag: create branch
    Membrane:
        ✓right click drag: continue the line of cell parts


Make the mouth work properly

✓Fix nearby detection

Fix transfering of cell parts between cells

Improve rendering
    - Make a custom shader for cell parts
