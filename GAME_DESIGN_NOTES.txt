Current problem:
    What is the gameplay?
        There are bad cells, and you want to kill them to take their parts to improve your cell.
    Where do bad cells come from?
    It's hard to make the cell do what you want
        Its because the flagellas are unaware of the rest of the cell
    When/how do you modify your cell?
        How: dragging; left click to move any part, right click to do the "secondary action"


In general, I'm not sure how to proceed.
Game design approach idea:
    focus on a few mechanics, and design the game around getting the player to use those mechanics.
    - Cell building ability
    - Attacking other cells
    - Exploring?
    - acquiring new cell parts

Need the ability to attack other cells

Why the "Exploring" mechanic is necessary:
    without this mechanic, this could be a battle arena type game, with
    attacking cells 1 at a time, and you win new cell parts, and can rearrange
    your cell each level.

    That's not what I want this game to be like


Maybe the world should be fixed size.
    Good. limits the scope, makes the game more "designable"
    Would all cells be preexisting? Or would they spawn in?
    Speaking of which, the current cell saving system is unmaintainable.
        Or is it?

Membrane problems:
    What is it for?
        Protection?
    Idea: Membrane is fixed shape, but if a link is broken, then nearby cell
    parts become loose
        Not sure what the value of this would be...

Exploring:
    What will it look like?
    Ideas from terraria:
        Different types of regions, with different backgrounds, types of cells who spawn...

        Maybe it shouldn't all be open; maybe heave some sort of branching cave-like, stuff

        Certain things will be "fixed", so they don't move.
